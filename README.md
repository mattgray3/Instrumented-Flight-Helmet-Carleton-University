I've broken down the code into 2 sections
- 'Blink Detection' can be downloaded, unzipped then uploaded to your primary google drive folder (In the Dataset section you'll need to UNZIP the Blinkdataset db file and upload that instead)
-    have not included the BLINK Dataset directly, just the version that I formated for this project. The original data can be found here: https://github.com/meagmohit/BLINK
- 'Google Drive Code' has all the code in google drives files so they should be easier to edit as some of them needed to be convereted to .py files to be called by other files

(Ps. I'm sorry this took so long to upload, I started work Fulltime the Thursday after classes ended, so that plus Easter weekend really took up a lot of my time. I also reformated the code so that all the functions are stored in a different file that can be called by both the optimization function and the blink detetion function to ensure parody between them. I also added the ability for the blink detection main loop tohandle all data types, single files and labeled and un-labeled data and for the database creation code to make sure that all files had exactly the same format. Optimization and Database Creation Code still need to be uploaded but that should be done by the end of the weekend. To whoever has this next, feel free to reach out to me (Nathan Tobin) if you have any questions about any of this!)
